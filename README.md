Hello! I'm Sangmin, a beginner developer. I recently developed a strong interest in software development and am now fully focused on learning. I'm currently exploring various technologies, starting with Java, and I find great satisfaction in solving problems and building programs.

Though I'm still learning, I’m committed to growing as a developer by studying and practicing every day. I'm especially interested in working with data and creating efficient, well-structured programs. I look forward to gaining more knowledge and experience on my journey to becoming a skilled developer. Thank you! 😊</p>
