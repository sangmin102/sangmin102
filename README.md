Hello! I'm Sangmin, a beginner developer.<br>
I recently developed a strong interest in software development and am now fully focused on learning.<br>
I'm currently exploring various technologies, starting with Java, and I find great satisfaction in solving problems and building programs.<br>

Though I'm still learning, Iâ€™m committed to growing as a developer by studying and practicing every day.<br>
I'm especially interested in working with data and creating efficient, well-structured programs.<br>
I look forward to gaining more knowledge and experience on my journey to becoming a skilled developer.<br>

Thank you! ðŸ˜Š</p>
